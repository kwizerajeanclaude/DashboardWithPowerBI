# DashboardWithPowerBI

These days, the success of a business depends on its owners' ability to recognize its challenges, obstacles, and best and worst situations.
One of the most common methods for gathering business information, predicting the future of the company, and extracting some of the knowledge that can help solve all of the company's issues is data analysis and visualization.
The project, Business Insights Amplification, aims to leverage the accumulated transactional data from the year 2019 to derive meaningful insights that empower our client to enhance sales, improve operational efficiency, and identify growth opportunities. 
The goal is to transform raw data into actionable intelligence, providing a comprehensive view of the business landscape.

This project is about visualizing about how sells was tranding during 2019 where I used the following questions to find out the insights

Question
--------
1. How much money did we make this year?
2. Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
3. What are our best and worst-selling products?
4. How do sales compare to previous months or weeks?
5. Which cities are our products delivered to most?
6. How do product categories compare in revenue generated and quantities ordered?

Here is the link for visualization
